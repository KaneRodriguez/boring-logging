**Warning:** This application is no longer being actively maintained!

Boring Logging was meant as an voice-based accessibility application to aid Civil Engineers with performing ground sample analysis by providing 3D sample data visualizations.

Voice-based assistance was enabled through the [Speech Kitt](https://github.com/TalAter/SpeechKITT) voice assistant. Intuitive actions were chosen to help a user create items, remove items, update specific fields, and more, all from their voice.

### Why?

It had come to our attention that Civil Engineers that were out in the field were relying solely on pencils and papers to record their data. Then, when they returned to the office they had to enter the data in a spread sheet.

We hoped to streamline this process by making the data readily availabe immediately after collection.

### Future
